"admin_only_account_cancel"
When an app is attached to a site, and the app has a account cancellation capability, then the cancel account permission needs to be made site wide on the website.

If this is not desirable, this module can be added to the site to stop non-admin users from cancelling accounts from the website but still allowing it from the app.

"easy_login_account_deletion_only"
Heavily cutdown easy_login module that can operate when only the user fullname field is available (there is no separate last name, first name fields).
Contains the minimum needed for the delete user anonymiser to work.
