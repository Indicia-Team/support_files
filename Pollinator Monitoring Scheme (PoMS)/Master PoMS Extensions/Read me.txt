Extension files that are shared between the FIT Count/SPRING and UKPoMS projects.
The files in this folder can be considered as the master files that include all the code from all the projects (in case the projects get out of sync).
When any of the shared projects are updated, these files should also be updated (ideally all the shared projects should use these master files).
