Completion of the list is the first time such a stocktake has been done in Scotland.

The Scottish Biodiversity List is a tool for public bodies and others doing their Biodiversity Duty. The publication of the Scottish Biodiversity List satisfies the requirements of Section 2(4) of The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.","Nat Legislation","ScotBL"

It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and a threatened status.
