Note that the scripts numbering is a bit odd.
They should just be run in order regardless if there appears to be missing scripts
e.g.
a possible running order might be as follows (if there are no other scripts in between)
1C
1E
3A
4B

This odd numbering is caused by scripts being removed and combined over time (e.g. the scripts only needed for the first ever run are kept in a separate folder)
