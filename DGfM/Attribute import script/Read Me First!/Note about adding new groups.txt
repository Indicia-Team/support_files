There is a script for adding new Lot groups in the "Scripts no longer needed" folder.
However I think any future imports will add only 1 or 2 groups (if any at all), you may as well add these individually in the Character Manager.
Note that the actual allocation to the Lot groups is still handled by script as that is a much bigger task.

This situation may change if further tests are carried out and we find that the group addition script is always 100% reliable in all situations, I have not run the script enough times to claim that yet so  may as well add individual ones in the Character Manager.
