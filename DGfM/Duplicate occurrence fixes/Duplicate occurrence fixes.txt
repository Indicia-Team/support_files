-- This script is designed to correct situation where duplicate occurrences have been created (why this happened I am not sure) and that the following situation applies:
-- In this case the situation is that the duplicates either had identical occurrence attribute values, or one of the duplicates had additional occurrence attribute values 
-- which were missing from the other duplicate. In these cases we delete the one with fewer occurrence attribute values.
-- The fix assumes that the one with more occurrence attribute values includes all the ones from the duplicate which has fewer occurrence attribute values.
